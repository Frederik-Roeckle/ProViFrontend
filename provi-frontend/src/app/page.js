        Dear Participant,
        <br />
        <br />
        My name is Marie-Christin Häge, and I am conducting this experiment as
        part of my PhD. The purpose of this study is to investigate Process
        Mining visualizations. Your participation is greatly appreciated and 
        will take around 20 minutes to complete.
        <br />
        <br />
        The survey is structured in 4 parts: 
        </p>

      <div className="my-6 flex justify-center">
        <Image
                    priority
                    src={Timeline}
                    width={1000}
                    height={600}
                    alt="Project Logo"
                  />
        {/* <img

        1) <strong>Consent:</strong> If you approve of the described procedure, you consent to 
        participate in this experiment for the Process Mining Visualizations (ProVi) research project.
        <br />
        <br />
        2) <strong>Pre-Experiment Questions:</strong> You will be presented with general questions and questions on Process
        Mining.
        <br />
        <br />
        3) <strong>Experiment:</strong> You will then see an interactive process model visualization where
        you will have to answer some questions about the process shown. You can
        interact with the visualization to get the information you need.
        <br />
        <br />
        4) <strong>Post-Experiment Questions:</strong> Finally, there is a post-experiment question.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Please always read the questions and tasks carefully and take the time
        for exploration with the visualization that you need to answer the
        questions.
        <br />
        Please be sure that the data collected from you will only be stored and
        analyzed for the purpose of conducting this experiment and the
        presentation of the results. Only data that is necessary and relevant
        for the evaluation of the study will be asked for.
        <br />
        <br />
        Thank you in advance for your participation and contribution to
        research! <br />
        <br />
        Best, <br />
